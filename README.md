# JS-Algorithms

This is a collection of algorithms, written primarily in Javascript, with some in Python. 

This collection includes:
- Data Structures - such as Linked Lists, Heaps, Binary Search Trees, Queues/Stacks, and Hash Tables
- Sorting Algorithms - from simple Bubble/Insertion sorts to more efficient algorithms such as Merge Sort. Most sorts are written for both Array/List structures and Linked Lists.
- Various utility functions - flatten nested arrays, remove duplicates, etc
- Logic puzzles/challenges
